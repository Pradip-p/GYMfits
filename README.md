## GYMFITS
> The purpose or objective of this system is to digitalize and create an automated system. The system will perform the task like adding the new member to the gym, Removing the member or keeping the payments records and other stuff required in managing the gym properly.

The present scenario in the gyms is that the records are kept by writing in a file on the paper. Every management task is done manually. This creates a system unreliable and confusing to keep the correct track of the records.

The maintenance of the system like this is hardly required until it needs to change any part of the system. The information about the various things contained in the system are like members, trainers, equipment can get by just a few clicks unlike the paper documents required the serious reading for such information.

It helps in creating the various batch according to their preference or if they want a particular trainer. It made easy to generate the reports of various operations performed in the gym are like paying the fee it can be stored and later evaluated and get the list of members who did not pay the fee.

It also helps the users in reducing the carbon footprint as the amount of paper used in company reduces.

This also helps in keeping the standard width of the management system as if there is a case where the administration involves more than one person to manage the gym.

This system does not only limit itself to the administration and but also helps the members of the gym. The members can have options like attendance and fee payment change batch request etc.

This will improve the transparency between the members which is always a good quality in the system. It will also give the layer of security to the administration and the users that only authorized users can access by their credentials.

Some major takeaways:

Online registration of the member

Issuing the timetable of batch on system

Increase transparency between stakeholders

Easy payment options

Standardization of the system
